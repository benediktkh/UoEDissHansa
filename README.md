# UoE Dissertation Benedikt Kalani Hansa

## Introduction and Summary
This GitHub repository supplements the Dissertation for the MSc Operational Research with Data Science degree from the University of Edinburgh written by Benedikt Kalani Hansa. The Dissertation aims to analyse efficiency gains from Merger and Acqusition Transactions (M&A) in the US banking sector betweeen 2014 and 2017. This repository includes the data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corperation (FDIC), a jupyter notebook describing the creation of the data, a python file with the models used in the analysis, and a jupyter notebook describing the analysis done.

## Abstract
The following is the abstract from the Dissertation aiming to give the reader an overview. It is highly recommended to every reader to read the Dissertation to understand this repository.

Data Envelopment Analysis has been widely used to measure the efficiency of Merger \& Acquisition transactions in various industries. Most papers on this subject made use of Window Analysis to compare changes in efficiencies over time. This approach ignores the effect of carry-overs that bridge time periods and may therefore bias the results. Addressing this issue, the Dynamic Slack Based Measure Model has been developed and gained significant attention in the literature. This dissertation aims to contribute to the research body by using this model to measure efficiency changes due to Merger and Acquisition Transactions. As a case study, the Mergers in the United States banking industry in the years from 2013 to 2017 is analysed. There is strong evidence that Mergers improve the efficiency of the banks under observation. Contrary to findings by other authors, there is however no statistically significant indication of a difference in efficiency gains between Targets and Acquirers. This suggest that both entities accrued similar benefits from the Merger. Finally, using the static Slack Based Measure model, it is shown that the exploitation of synergies was not the major reason for efficiency gains, suggesting other factors beyond synergistic effects contribute to efficiency gains. </p>
